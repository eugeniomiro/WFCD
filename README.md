## Wife First Conference Display

The application name makes no sense if context is not explained, so here we go.
My wife asked me for a light to tell her when to enter without being caught in camera or to be able to enter without disturbing my conference calls, that's why I came out with that name.

At first I started thinking on Arduino receiving a signal from a Windows app/service, which in turn monitors Microsoft Teams (which is the tool I use today for my conferences) but Skype is also used, so I started to think on monitoring directly the camera and the microphone, as Windows itself does, but that requires investigation so I will take my wife's initial approach and create just an electrical cirquit with two lights and two switches and make that my 1.0 version.

I will later start adding features like automatic camera detection, automatic mic detection, through USB at first then through Bluetooth or WiFi, and add a display with information about what I'm doing if that's possible.

This may be a pretty fun project to do, so let's start with it

To start I will create an schematic file with the electric circuit for the first lights... no code here, but fun...
